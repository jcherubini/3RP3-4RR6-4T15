✍️ **What activities count as "recordable hours"?** Recordable hours include anything performed in the lab that are not directly related to the required assignments for your 3RP3 course. These include central lab duties, such as image stacking, attending data collection sessions, data anlysis, participation in lab meetings, and participation in journal club. Working on your mid-term reflection or problem statement, however, would not count towards recordable hours because these tasks are part of the assignments required for the 3RP3 course. You're encouraged to get creative with your hours, and work with your supervisor to create a plan to achieve hours related to tasks that align with your own personal goals and objectives for your 3RP3 experience :smile:!
